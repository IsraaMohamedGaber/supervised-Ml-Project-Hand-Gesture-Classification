# supervised-Ml-Project-Hand-Gesture-Classification
Hand Gesture Classification Using MediaPipe Landmarks from the HaGRID Dataset

This project detects hand gestures in real-time using a webcam and classifies them using a machine learning model trained on hand landmark data from **MediaPipe**.

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- ðŸ“· Real-time hand tracking using **OpenCV** and **MediaPipe**
- ðŸ§  Machine learning classification using **Random Forest, SVM, and KNN**
- ðŸŽ¯ Normalization of hand landmarks for accurate prediction
- âœ… Pre-trained model for quick usage
